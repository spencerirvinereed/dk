Saw a colleague wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.

He said he has been a fan for all of his life, yet he grew up in a reservation in New Mexico.
He had no running or electricity growing up.

Then how did you watch games, radio?
He concurred, while watching sheeps at night, they would tune into an AM radion station in Albuquerque.

Mentioned that I grew up in DC area.
We gave one another rivalry speeches.

He said, when he found out that each football team had mascots, he was interested.
When he saw the Eagles were the Philadelphia's mascot, he had found his lifelong team.

Asked what he thought of the name change of Washington Commanders.
And whether he was offended by the name Redskins.

> I loved the name, they shoud have kept the name.

He said that was the wrong decision.
Made by people with nothing better to do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My father and I, along with sisters started following Football games.
My mom, not so much.

It took us several years to understand the intricacies of the game.
Once we understood the basics, we became a devoted fans.

At that time, our enemies were the Cardinals, Eagles, Giants, and the Cowboys.
We hated those Cowboys.

A loss by team would effect my mood, sometimes for days.
If the loss came at the hands of those Cowboys.

I left Washington area when Redskins reached their heights.
Winning Super Bowl while I was serving a mission.

Even when I moved to Utah, I would check their scores once in a while.
Then years of famine, no decades of futility followed.

There were few flashes of success, including 10 years ago when Robert Griffin III was drafted.
I was nearly freed from following the team, seemingly destined for NFL mediocrity.

Then came Daniel, Jayden Daniels (JD)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not only did he turned the fortunes of the team, he brought a dimension to football seldom seen.
He talked of Lord, regularly.

In one interview, he said

> Praise the Lord

In another, he began and ended the converstation with,

> Trust in the Lord

A commentator, commenting on recent success of JD, invoked the Biblical story of Daniel going into the Den of Lions.

Refreshing to hear an athlete give credit to the Source of all blessings and wisdom Football with other sports have become a source of entertainment.

However, it is always reassuring to hear a young person recognize help from others.

Regardless of the outcome of the rest of the season, we now have a winner that represents the Nation's Capital and the surrounding areas of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV).

> Hail to the Redskins!
