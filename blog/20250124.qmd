Returned to the place of daily commune. For last few days, single digit (Farenheit) temperatures kept me inside.

Met a couple from Salt Lake. They were all set to climb the Peak.

They complimented on having this kind of canyon nearby.

They were all business, almost intense

Then the locals came. They came sauntering down the path. Following their 月, 水, 金 schedule for hiking.

One of them said "Happy New Year!"

Then commented, it is the year of the Snake, since last year was Dragon.

I asked how do you know so much.

He replied,

> It helps to pay attention

The morning air, along with greetings and surroundings, seemed to clear my mind.

Thoughts came,

We've all had a beginning, beyond mortal reckoning, elsewhere.

We will all return to that place of gathering.

Some further along that journey, all traveling at different pace.

> What do we value?
>
> Who are our fellow travelers?
>
> What would be our legacies?

I have taken far more Sunset Photos than Sunrise Photos.

Could be that the Wasatch Front lends itself to west-focused photos.

It may be that I am not as diligent or pay attention as those 3 older hikers do.

In those morning sunrise, there seems to be a hint, a foreshadowing of the eventual sunset.

A melancholic, fan favorite song echoes these words

언제나 돌아오는 계절은 나에게 꿈을 주지만 이룰 수 없는 꿈은 슬퍼요 나를 울려요

Ever returning (regularity of) seasons gives me hope. Unrealized dreams, a painful reminder.

Like to amend the second line to

Ever returning (regularity of) seasons gives me hope. For it gives me a chance to realize dreams of past generations.

Thank you fellow hikers for recognizing me. For reminding me of the Lunar, Chinese New Year.

Which reinforces the nature's reminder. Each sunset contains, a promise of a new day, a new beginning.
