    "text": "A big part of American buildings are its parking lots. If planned correctly, one can get some exercise walking to and from the parked car to the place of work.\nOften, one notices, luxury cars. How it would be to drive a BMW 7 series or a Lexus LX (Land Cruiser)\nIn many of the factories in the Salt Lake Valley, one can find immigrants at work. Hard workers, often not able to communicate in the language of the workplace. Surprising to hear that they held a professional roles, yet consigned to manual labor roles in America.\nAs a group of engineers, we were preparing for an upcoming Phase Review. We lamented the un-fair, low value-added, tasks we were asked to complete.\nWe agreed that the better review might be a peer review. A fellow engineer questioning the work of another technical worker.\nHowever enlightened that approach, we will never get to practice that methodology. In this era of ISO,\nIt seems, by signing up for an international order, we often give up flexibility as well as efficacy of simpler approaches\nRecall an exchange between Milton Friedman and a college student.1\nThe young man gave, 100% Inheritance Tax a possible means of re-distributing the wealth.\nMilton then gave this lecture to the young man\nIt is not surprising to find immigrant’s children become quickly assimilated, and taken on the role of that their parents held, in the new country.\nBrings to mind words found in Matthew, 20th Chapter\nI will continue in the path of chosen profession and faith.\nThat by leaving something for the children, that something will have a higher utility and meaning for them.\nAs my parents did for me and my siblings."

    "text": "Saw a colleague wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\nHe said he has been a fan for all of his life, yet he grew up in a reservation in New Mexico. He had no running or electricity growing up.\nThen how did you watch games, radio? He concurred, while watching sheeps at night, they would tune into an AM radion station in Albuquerque.\nMentioned that I grew up in DC area. We gave one another rivalry speeches.\nHe said, when he found out that each football team had mascots, he was interested. When he saw the Eagles were the Philadelphia’s mascot, he had found his lifelong team.\nAsked what he thought of the name change of Washington Commanders. And whether he was offended by the name Redskins.\n\nI loved the name, they shoud have kept the name.\n\nHe said that was the wrong decision. Made by people with nothing better to do.\n\nMy father and I, along with sisters started following Football games. My mom, not so much.\nIt took us several years to understand the intricacies of the game. Once we understood the basics, we became a devoted fans.\nAt that time, our enemies were the Cardinals, Eagles, Giants, and the Cowboys. We hated those Cowboys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Washington Football Team Winning Percentage: Last 50 Years\n\n\n\n\n\nI left Washington area when Redskins reached their heights. Winning Super Bowl while I was serving a mission.\nEven when I moved to Utah, I would check their scores once in a while.\nThen years of famine, no decades of futility followed.\nThere were few flashes of success, including 10 years ago when Robert Griffin III was drafted.\nThen came Daniel, Jayden Daniels (JD)\n\nNot only did he turned the fortunes of the team, he brought a dimension to football seldom seen. He talked of Lord, regularly.\nIn one interview, he said\n\nPraise the Lord\n\nIn another, he began and ended the converstation with,\n\nTrust in the Lord\n\nA commentator, commenting on recent success of JD, invoked the Biblical story of Daniel going into the Den of Lions.\nRefreshing to hear an athlete give credit to the Source of all blessings and wisdom Football with other sports have become a source of entertainment.\nHowever, it is always reassuring to hear a young person recognize help from others.\nRegardless of the outcome of the rest of the season, we now have a winner that represents the Nation’s Capital and the surrounding areas of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV).\n\nHail to the Redskins!"

    "text": "Returned to the place of daily commune. For last few days, single digit (Farenheit) temperatures kept me inside.\nMet a couple from Salt Lake. They were all set to climb the Peak.\nThey complimented on having this kind of canyon nearby.\nThey were all business, almost intense\n\n\n\nSLC Couple\n\n\nThen the locals came. They came sauntering down the path. Following their 月, 水, 金 schedule for hiking.\nOne of them said “Happy New Year!”\nThen commented, it is the year of the Snake, since last year was Dragon.\nI asked how do you know so much.\nHe replied,\n\nIt helps to pay attention\n\n\n\n\nLocals; Paul and Grant\n\n\n\nThe morning air, along with greetings and surroundings, seemed to clear my mind.\nThoughts came,\nWe’ve all had a beginning, beyond mortal reckoning, elsewhere.\nWe will all return to that place of gathering.\nSome further along that journey, all traveling at different pace.\n\nWhat do we value?\nWho are our fellow travelers?\nWhat would be our legacies?\n\n\nI have taken far more Sunset Photos than Sunrise Photos.\nCould be that the Wasatch Front lends itself to west-focused photos.\nIt may be that I am not as diligent or pay attention as those 3 older hikers do.\nIn those morning sunrise, there seems to be a hint, a foreshadowing of the eventual sunset.\n\n\n\n18 Jan 2025 Morning\n\n\n\nA melancholic, fan favorite song echoes these words\n언제나 돌아오는 계절은 나에게 꿈을 주지만 이룰 수 없는 꿈은 슬퍼요 나를 울려요\nEver returning (regularity of) seasons gives me hope. Unrealized dreams, a painful reminder.\nLike to amend the second line to\nEver returning (regularity of) seasons gives me hope. For it gives me a chance to realize dreams of past generations.\nThank you fellow hikers for recognizing me. For reminding me of the Lunar, Chinese New Year.\nWhich reinforces the nature’s reminder. Each sunset contains, a promise of a new day, a new beginning.\n\n\n\n18 Jan 2025 Evening"
